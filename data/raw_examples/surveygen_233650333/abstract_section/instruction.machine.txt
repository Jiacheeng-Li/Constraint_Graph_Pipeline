SURVEY GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. SURVEY TASK BRIEF
   - Core survey objective: Write a rigorous Introduction section for a survey on publicly available automatic brain segmentation methodologies.
   - Deliverable type: a complete survey report with section-level synthesis and citation grounding.
   - Source survey topic: A Review of Publicly Available Automatic Brain Segmentation Methodologies, Machine Learning Models, Recent Advancements, and Their Comparison

2. SURVEY-LEVEL CONSTRAINTS
   Respect every survey-level rule simultaneously across the full report:
   1. Avoid contractions (use 'do not' instead of 'don't').
   2. Target a response of 460–650 words.
   3. Do not use emojis or decorative unicode symbols.
   4. Restrict headings to the following levels: [2].
   5. Ensure the response is predominantly in English.
   6. Structure the discussion to logically progress from problem statement to solution approaches.
   7. Include citations and references to support claims and establish credibility.
   8. Prefer a formal and academic tone suitable for a scientific review.
   9. Avoid overly simplistic explanations; assume the reader has some domain knowledge.
   10. Use technical terminology precisely to maintain scientific rigor.
   11. Support core claims with inline citations and include at least 14 citation markers across the full response.
   12. Use at least 8 distinct cited sources in the response.
   13. Keep a consistent citation style throughout the response (detected style: ref_id).
   14. Anchor the survey to core domain concepts and explicitly cover: Identification, Medical Image Segmentation Techniques, Functional Brain Connectivity Studies.
   15. Use evidence-grounded citations across the report and ensure the required evidence coverage.
   - Build the introduction around these themes and synthesize relevant literature: Identification, Medical Image Segmentation Techniques, Functional Brain Connectivity Studies, Brain Tumor Detection and Classification.

3. SECTION-BY-SECTION SYNTHESIS PLAN
   Follow the original survey section flow; each section should synthesize evidence rather than isolated claims.

   Section 1 - Opening
      Logic cue: Synthesize this section's key points with coherent literature context.
      Timeline duties:
        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 40 words.
        • Keep this section focused on its heading theme: Opening.

   Section 2 - Context setup
      Logic cue: Synthesize this section's key points with coherent literature context.
      Timeline duties:
        • Introduce a key methodological tool used within the established field.
        • Establish the broad scientific field and its relevance to research and clinical practice.
        • List specific anatomical or structural targets of interest within the field.
        • Keep this section focused on its heading theme: Context setup.

   Section 3 - Background
      Logic cue: Synthesize this section's key points with coherent literature context.
      Timeline duties:
        • State the practical necessity or prerequisite role of the core technical task.
        • Provide at least two concrete examples of conditions or fields where the application is relevant.
        • List at least three distinct application domains or downstream tasks enabled by the core technical task.

   Section 4 - Main Analysis
      Logic cue: Synthesize this section's key points with coherent literature context.
      Timeline duties:
        • List at least two neurological conditions where segmentation of this structure is clinically relevant
        • Connect structural changes to their potential use as biomarkers
        • Keep this section focused on its heading theme: Main Analysis.

   Section 5 - Counterargument
      Logic cue: Synthesize this section's key points with coherent literature context.
      Timeline duties:
        • Cite multiple supporting references for the clinical associations.
        • Introduce at least one additional brain structure beyond the primary subject of discussion.
        • Link the additional structures to their clinical or pathological significance.
        • Keep this section focused on its heading theme: Counterargument.

   Section 6 - Recommendation
      Logic cue: Synthesize this section's key points with coherent literature context.
      Timeline duties:
        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 50 words.
        • Mention the tools or software used in the execution of the method.
        • Keep this section focused on its heading theme: Recommendation.

   Section 7 - Conclusion
      Logic cue: Synthesize this section's key points with coherent literature context.
      Timeline duties:
        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 70 words.
        • Acknowledge the role of technological advancements in enabling the development of the field.
        • List at least three specific, publicly available software tools relevant to the field.
        • Note a current trend or emerging approach within the field's methodology.
        • Use section-relevant evidence citations and maintain coverage of the required evidence set.

   Section 8 - Outlook
      Logic cue: Synthesize this section's key points with coherent literature context.
      Timeline duties:
        • Indicate that a comparative analysis will be provided for at least one topic.
        • List at least three distinct major topics to be covered.
        • Preview the structure of the remaining document sections.
        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 30 words.
        • Keep this section focused on its heading theme: Outlook.
