Your task is to write a rigorous Introduction section for a survey titled "A Review of Publicly Available Automatic Brain Segmentation Methodologies, Machine Learning Models, Recent Advancements, and Their Comparison." The deliverable must be a complete survey report section with synthesis and proper citation grounding.

Throughout the entire report, you must simultaneously adhere to all global rules. You must use bracketed numeric references like [3] and write in English. The introduction itself must be a minimum of three paragraphs. You must incorporate the exact keywords "segmentation," "brain," and "alzheimer's." In your writing, prefer citing specific examples and applications to illustrate general points, and maintain a formal, academic tone suitable for a scientific review. Prefer providing comprehensive background and context before delving into specifics. You must support core claims with inline citations, including at least 14 citation markers across the full response drawn from at least 8 distinct sources, while keeping a consistent citation style. You must anchor the survey to the core domain concepts of Identification, Medical Image Segmentation Techniques, and Functional Brain Connectivity Studies, using evidence-grounded citations to ensure this required coverage. Finally, build the introduction around the themes of Identification, Medical Image Segmentation Techniques, Functional Brain Connectivity Studies, and Brain Tumor Detection and Classification, synthesizing relevant literature on these topics.

Begin by writing one coherent introduction with clear paragraph flow, moving from background to motivation, then to a landscape of key methods, and finally a transition. Synthesize this section's key points with coherent literature context, maintaining a survey-style synthesis aligned with the section heading of "Introduction."

Conclude by ensuring your final text is a self-contained introduction that meets all the specified requirements for length, keyword inclusion, citation count and diversity, thematic coverage, and academic tone, without introducing any assumptions not present in the original instructions.
