SURVEY GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. SURVEY TASK BRIEF
   - Core survey objective: Write a rigorous Introduction section for a survey on publicly available automatic brain segmentation methodologies.
   - Deliverable type: a complete survey report with section-level synthesis and citation grounding.
   - Source survey topic: A Review of Publicly Available Automatic Brain Segmentation Methodologies, Machine Learning Models, Recent Advancements, and Their Comparison

2. SURVEY-LEVEL CONSTRAINTS
   Respect every survey-level rule simultaneously across the full report:
   1. Use bracketed numeric references, such as [3].
   2. Use English as the primary language for the answer.
   3. Write a minimum of 3 paragraphs.
   4. Incorporate the keywords exactly as listed: "segmentation", "brain", "alzheimer's".
   5. Prefer citing specific examples and applications to illustrate general points.
   6. Prefer a formal and academic tone suitable for a scientific review.
   7. Prefer providing comprehensive background and context before delving into specifics.
   8. Support core claims with inline citations and include at least 14 citation markers across the full response.
   9. Use at least 8 distinct cited sources in the response.
   10. Keep a consistent citation style throughout the response (detected style: ref_id).
   11. Anchor the survey to core domain concepts and explicitly cover: Identification, Medical Image Segmentation Techniques, Functional Brain Connectivity Studies.
   12. Use evidence-grounded citations across the report and ensure the required evidence coverage.
   - Build the introduction around these themes and synthesize relevant literature: Identification, Medical Image Segmentation Techniques, Functional Brain Connectivity Studies, Brain Tumor Detection and Classification.

3. INTRODUCTION WRITING PLAN
   Write one coherent introduction with clear paragraph flow (background -> motivation -> key methods landscape -> transition).

   Section 1 - Introduction
      Logic cue: Synthesize this section's key points with coherent literature context.
      Timeline duties: Maintain survey-style synthesis aligned with this section heading.
