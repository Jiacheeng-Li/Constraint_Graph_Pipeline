Your task is to compose a rigorous Introduction section for a survey titled "A Review of Publicly Available Automatic Brain Segmentation Methodologies, Machine Learning Models, Recent Advancements, and Their Comparison." The final deliverable must be a complete survey report section characterized by synthesis and proper citation grounding.

Throughout the entire response, you must simultaneously adhere to several non-negotiable constraints. The character colon must not appear anywhere in your text. Maintain an impersonal register, avoiding any first-person references. The answer must contain a minimum of 460 words and not exceed 650 words. You should employ precise technical terminology appropriate for the domain and favor the use of specific examples and applications to illustrate general concepts. The tone must be formal and academic, suitable for a scientific review. All core claims require support from inline citations, with at least 14 citation markers distributed across the response, drawing from a minimum of 8 distinct sources from the provided fixed reference list. A consistent citation style, specifically the ref_id style, must be used throughout. Furthermore, the survey must be anchored to core domain concepts, explicitly covering Identification, Medical Image Segmentation Techniques, and Functional Brain Connectivity Studies. All citations must be evidence-grounded to ensure the required coverage.

Begin by writing one coherent introduction with clear paragraph flow, moving from background to motivation, then to a landscape of key methods, and finally a transition. Synthesize this section's key points within a coherent literature context. Your duty is to maintain a survey-style synthesis that aligns precisely with the Introduction section heading.

Finally, ensure your completed introduction meets all the stated word count, formatting, citation, and content coverage requirements without introducing any assumptions not present in the original instructions.
