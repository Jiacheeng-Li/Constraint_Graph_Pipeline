SURVEY GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. SURVEY TASK BRIEF
   - Core survey objective: Write a rigorous Introduction section for a survey on publicly available automatic brain segmentation methodologies.
   - Deliverable type: a complete survey report with section-level synthesis and citation grounding.
   - Source survey topic: A Review of Publicly Available Automatic Brain Segmentation Methodologies, Machine Learning Models, Recent Advancements, and Their Comparison

2. SURVEY-LEVEL CONSTRAINTS
   Respect every survey-level rule simultaneously across the full report:
   1. The character ':' must not appear in the answer.
   2. Keep the register impersonal; avoid first-person references.
   3. Your answer should be no shorter than 460 and no longer than 650 words.
   4. Prefer using technical terminology precisely and appropriately for the domain.
   5. Prefer citing specific examples and applications to illustrate general concepts.
   6. Prefer a formal and academic tone suitable for a scientific review.
   7. Support core claims with inline citations and include at least 14 citation markers across the full response.
   8. Use at least 8 distinct cited sources in the response.
   9. Keep a consistent citation style throughout the response (detected style: ref_id).
   10. Anchor the survey to core domain concepts and explicitly cover: Identification, Medical Image Segmentation Techniques, Functional Brain Connectivity Studies.
   11. Use evidence-grounded citations across the report and ensure the required evidence coverage.
