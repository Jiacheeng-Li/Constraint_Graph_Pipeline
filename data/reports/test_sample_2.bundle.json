You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).\n\nStage B2 — TBD:\n- This stage is 'TBD'. You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).\n\nStage B3 — TBD:\n- This stage is 'TBD'. You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).\n\nEVALUATION NOTICE:\n- Your answer will be automatically checked against the global constraints, the stage duties, and (if applicable) the branch you chose.\n- You MUST clearly follow EXACTLY ONE branch for each conditional stage. Do NOT merge branches.\n- Automated verifiers will check things like required language, tone, length, inclusion of specific elements, actionable recommendations, numbered items, etc.\n",
