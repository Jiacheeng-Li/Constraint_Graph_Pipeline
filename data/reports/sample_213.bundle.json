  "machine_prompt": "Your task is to compare and contrast the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War. The final deliverable should be a written analysis that clearly examines both the similarities and differences between these two historical events.\n\nThere are several non-negotiable rules that must be followed throughout the entire response. The structure must include an opening or introduction, a body or main analysis, and a conclusion or outlook, presented in a logical progression. You are not permitted to use the colon symbol. The words \"vietnam,\" \"cuban,\" and \"missile\" must appear verbatim somewhere in your text. The response should be written mostly in English and must total at least 320 words. It is essential to highlight key differences between the subjects to aid understanding. You must conclude with a summary that reinforces the main points and provide background context to help frame the discussion. The tone should remain neutral and informative, suitable for historical analysis, and you should prefer clear and logical reasoning when comparing and contrasting the topics.\n\nBegin your response by acknowledging both the similarities and differences between the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War. Next, provide background context with a sufficiently detailed explanation of at least 50 words. In the main analysis, you must present at least one key characteristic of the second case being contrasted, which is the Vietnam War. Then, at the next stage of the main analysis, a decision point is reached. If the analysis requires a more analytical and data-driven approach rather than a narrative historical comparison, you must include specific polling data or statistics to quantify public opinion levels, analyze at least three distinct demographic factors that influenced public opinion differently in each conflict, compare the media coverage patterns and their impact on public perception between the two events, and maintain an objective, data-focused tone throughout the analysis. Otherwise, at this same decision point, you must provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 60 words, provide concrete evidence of public sentiment for each case, contrast the outcomes or consequences of public opinion between the cases, and compare at least two cases on a specific dimension of public opinion. Finally, for the conclusion, another decision point is encountered. If the conclusion needs to emphasize policy implications and lessons learned rather than just summarizing differences, you must explicitly state at least two policy lessons or strategic implications drawn from comparing these events, use language that emphasizes strategic importance and contemporary relevance, maintain a forward-looking perspective that connects historical analysis to modern contexts, and explicitly mark the block as a conclusion with implications. Otherwise, at this same decision point, you must provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 40 words, restate the main comparative framework established earlier in the response, summarize key contrasting attributes for each case, and explicitly mark the block as a conclusion.\n\nUnless you are instructed otherwise, assume that the analysis does not require a more analytical and data-driven approach, meaning the default path for the main analysis branch should be followed. Also assume that the conclusion does not need to emphasize policy implications, meaning the default path for the conclusion branch should be followed.",
