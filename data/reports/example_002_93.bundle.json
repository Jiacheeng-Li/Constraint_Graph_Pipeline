CURRENT CONDITION ASSUMPTION\n   Unless the evaluator states otherwise, assume each trigger below is currently FALSE.\n   - Step Description: The cooking guide is not targeted at beginners who may not have specialized pasta-making equipment.\n   - Step Description: It is not the case that the cooking guide targets experienced chefs looking for advanced techniques and flavor development.\n   - Step Description: The cooking guide is not targeted at advanced cooks who prefer richer, more complex flavor combinations.\n   - Tips: The cooking guide is not targeted at advanced home cooks who want to experiment with variations.\n\n5. EVALUATION NOTICE\n- Automated checks will verify every global rule, each stage’s duties, and the branch-specific obligations you triggered.\n- Once you pick a branch, treat all bullets under that branch as mandatory, and do not mix incompatible paths unless explicitly told to merge.\n- Language, tone, structural cues, and conditional behaviors are all inspected.\n",
