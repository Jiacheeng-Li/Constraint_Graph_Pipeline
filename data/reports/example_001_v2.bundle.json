  "machine_prompt": "OVERALL TASK:\n- Write a short story showing cooperation among forest animals during a storm in a gentle, natural tone and ending with a reflective message.\n\nGLOBAL MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS:\nYou MUST satisfy ALL of the following properties throughout the entire answer:\n- The answer must be at least 184 words long (approximately comparable length to the provided reference).\n- The answer must be written primarily in English.\n- The answer must include an Opening/Intro section, a Main Analysis/Body section, and a Conclusion/Outlook section in logical progression.\n- The answer should maintain an objective, third-person analytic voice without using first-person pronouns.\n\nREQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE (STAGED PLAN):\nYour answer MUST be organized into the following stages / sections.\nYou do not need to literally copy these headings, but you MUST perform the listed duties.\n\nStage B1 — Opening:\n- This stage is 'Opening'. You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).\n  • Establish a forest setting with a coming storm\n  • Introduce multiple animal characters by name\n  • Show animals performing cooperative actions\n  • Use gentle, natural tone with descriptive nature imagery\n  • Use urgent, tense language describing the storm as threatening\n  • Describe animals acting with haste and alarm\n  • Maintain tense, urgent tone throughout the opening\n  • Include at least three different urgent animal actions\n\nStage B2 — Main Analysis:\n- This stage is 'Main Analysis'. You MUST: Follow these sub-steps IN ORDER.\n  • Describe the storm's arrival and immediate effects\n  • Show animals huddling together in shared shelter\n  • Include specific animal interactions during the storm\n  • Show the storm's progression from intensity to easing\n  • Describe the aftermath visible when animals emerge\n  • Include at least three distinct emotional states experienced by different animals during the storm\n  • Describe specific comforting actions taken by animals to support each other\n  • Show animals actively working together to improve their shelter during the storm\n  • Maintain a tone focused on resilience and mutual care rather than just survival\n\nStage B3 — Recommendation:\n- This stage is 'Recommendation'. You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).\n  • Include at least three distinct animal actions\n  • Maintain gentle natural tone throughout\n  • Convey a sense of restoration and gratitude\n\nStage B4 — Conclusion:\n- This stage is 'Conclusion'. You MUST: Follow these sub-steps IN ORDER.\n  • Describe the scene after the storm with the sun returning\n  • Show creatures helping each other in gentle ways\n  • End with a reflective message about forest strength through unity\n\nCONDITIONAL BRANCH REQUIREMENTS:\nSome stages include branching logic. You MUST clearly choose ONE branch that applies, and then satisfy ONLY that branch's obligations.\n\nIn stage B1 Opening:\nIF If the story needs to emphasize immediate danger and urgency rather than gentle cooperation THEN you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:\n    • Use urgent, tense language describing the storm as threatening\n    • Describe animals acting with haste and alarm\n    • Maintain tense, urgent tone throughout the opening\n    • Include at least three different urgent animal actions\nELSE (if the condition does not apply), you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:\n    • Establish a forest setting with a coming storm\n    • Introduce multiple animal characters by name\n    • Show animals performing cooperative actions\n    • Use gentle, natural tone with descriptive nature imagery\n\nIn stage B2 Main Analysis:\nIF If the story needs to emphasize the animals' emotional resilience and individual contributions to collective comfort during the storm THEN you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:\n    • Include at least three distinct emotional states experienced by different animals during the storm\n    • Describe specific comforting actions taken by animals to support each other\n    • Show animals actively working together to improve their shelter during the storm\n    • Maintain a tone focused on resilience and mutual care rather than just survival\nELSE (if the condition does not apply), you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:\n    • Describe the storm's arrival and immediate effects\n    • Show animals huddling together in shared shelter\n    • Include specific animal interactions during the storm\n    • Show the storm's progression from intensity to easing\n    • Describe the aftermath visible when animals emerge\n\nEVALUATION NOTICE:\n- Your answer will be automatically checked against the global constraints, the stage duties, and (if applicable) the branch you chose.\n- You MUST clearly follow EXACTLY ONE branch for each conditional stage. Do NOT merge branches.\n- Automated verifiers will check things like required language, tone, length, inclusion of specific elements, actionable recommendations, numbered items, etc.\n",
