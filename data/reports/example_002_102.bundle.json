MISSION BRIEF & DELIVERABLE\n   - Primary directive: Write a detailed Markdown-formatted cooking guide for homemade pasta with tomato basil sauce in an instructive yet friendly tone.\n\n2. NON-NEGOTIABLE GLOBAL RULES\n   Respect every rule simultaneously across the full response:\n   1. Aim for roughly 196 words, with a tolerance of ±15%.\n   2. Do not use contractions; write out full forms.\n   3. Present the response in no fewer than 13 paragraphs.\n   4. Use a consistent list marker style ('-'); do not mix list markers.\n   5. Write without first-person perspective throughout.\n   6. Prefer clear and sequential step-by-step instructions.\n   7. Prefer highlighting important notices or warnings prominently.\n   8. Prefer including practical tips and substitutions for flexibility.\n   9. Prefer concise and direct phrasing without unnecessary elaboration.\n   10. Prefer separating ingredients from instructions for clarity.\n\n3. STRUCTURED RESPONSE BLUEPRINT\n   Work chronologically through each stage. Tasks must already be described with the condition that governs when they apply.\n\n   Stage 1 – Opening\n      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.\n      Timeline duties:\n        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 30 words.\n        • Use an emoji in the title to create a friendly tone\n        • Include a descriptive title for the guide\n\n   Stage 2 – Notice\n      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.\n      Timeline duties:\n        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 30 words.\n        • Use explicit visual markers (emoji/symbols) to draw attention to important notices\n        • Issue a dietary restriction warning before proceeding with instructions\n\n   Stage 3 – Step Instructions\n      Logic cue: Sequential micro-steps: address bullets in a flowing order.\n      Timeline duties:\n        • Use a consistent bullet style '-' for list items in this block.\n        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 36 words.\n        • Provide a bulleted list in this block with at least 5 items.\n        • Include specific time durations for steps where applicable\n        • List required ingredients with quantities and units\n        • Present numbered steps in sequential order\n\n   Stage 4 – Step Instructions\n      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.\n      LOCAL branch – when The cooking guide is targeted at complete beginners who need extra reassurance and troubleshooting guidance:\n        • Include at least two troubleshooting tips for common pasta rolling problems\n        • Use encouraging, reassuring language that addresses beginner anxiety\n        • Provide visual cues for proper dough texture and thickness\n        • Include a minimum word count of 50 words to ensure thorough explanation\n      Otherwise at this same decision point:\n        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 30 words.\n        • Use a consistent bullet style '-' for list items in this block.\n        • Provide a bulleted list in this block with at least 3 items.\n        • Present a numbered step with a clear title\n        • Specify tools or equipment for at least one action\n        • List at least three distinct actions in bullet points\n\n   Stage 5 – Step Instructions\n      Logic cue: Sequential micro-steps: address bullets in a flowing order.\n      GLOBAL branch – when The cooking guide is targeted at advanced chefs who prefer improvisational cooking with flexible measurements:\n        - Step 1: Step Instructions\n            • Use descriptive measurements instead of precise quantities (e.g., 'a generous glug of olive oil', 'a handful of fresh basil')\n            • Provide sensory cues and visual indicators for doneness rather than strict timing\n            • Include at least 3 optional ingredient variations or substitutions\n            • Use chef's intuition language rather than numbered steps\n            • Maintain a conversational, improvisational tone throughout the instructions\n        - Step 2: Advanced Variations\n            • Provide at least 3 gourmet variations of the basic sauce recipe\n        - Step 3: Step Instructions\n            • Diagnose at least two critical failures driving the alternate scenario.\n            • Maintain an openly critical tone that assigns accountability for those failures.\n        - Step 4: Tips\n            • Lay out an urgent recovery plan using numbered steps.\n            • Highlight the need for rapid collaborative action to stabilize the situation.\n      Otherwise at this same decision point:\n        - Step 1: Step Instructions\n            • Provide a bulleted list in this block with at least 6 items.\n            • Organize this block into at least 2 logical paragraphs.\n            • Use a consistent bullet style '-' for list items in this block.\n            • Present numbered steps in chronological order\n            • List required ingredients with quantities and preparation notes\n            • Specify ingredient preparation states when needed\n        - Step 2: Step Instructions\n            Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.\n            LOCAL branch – when The cooking guide is targeted at advanced home cooks who want to optimize flavor and texture:\n              • Include at least two advanced serving techniques for enhancing pasta dish quality\n              • Specify pasta water retention technique for better sauce adhesion\n              • Recommend finishing technique that involves off-heat tossing\n              • Provide specific plating recommendation for optimal presentation\n            Otherwise at this same decision point:\n              • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 30 words.\n              • Use a consistent bullet style '-' for list items in this block.\n              • Provide a bulleted list in this block with at least 3 items.\n              • Offer at least one optional ingredient addition\n              • Specify cooking time and doneness target for the pasta\n              • Provide a numbered step title that indicates combining and serving\n        - Step 3: Tips\n            Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.\n            LOCAL branch – when The cooking guide is targeted at advanced home cooks who want to elevate their pasta dish with professional techniques:\n              • Provide at least three advanced technique tips that go beyond basic substitutions and timing\n              • Include at least one wine pairing recommendation for the finished dish\n              • Suggest at least two garnish options to enhance presentation\n              • Maintain an advanced cooking tone suitable for experienced home chefs\n            Otherwise at this same decision point:\n              • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 30 words.\n              • Use a consistent bullet style '-' for list items in this block.\n              • Provide a bulleted list in this block with at least 2 items.\n              • Provide at least one substitution option for a key ingredient\n              • Include timing or serving recommendation for optimal results\n      Global path note: Once you enter this alternate storyline, remain on it until it naturally merges back into the main sequence.\n\n4. CURRENT CONDITION ASSUMPTION\n   Unless the evaluator states otherwise, assume each trigger below is currently FALSE.\n   - Step Instructions: The cooking guide is not targeted at complete beginners who need extra reassurance and troubleshooting guidance.\n   - Step Instructions: The cooking guide is not targeted at advanced chefs who prefer improvisational cooking with flexible measurements.\n   - Step Instructions: The cooking guide is not targeted at advanced home cooks who want to optimize flavor and texture.\n   - Tips: The cooking guide is not targeted at advanced home cooks who want to elevate their pasta dish with professional techniques.\n\n5. EVALUATION NOTICE\n- Automated checks will verify every global rule, each stage’s duties, and the branch-specific obligations you triggered.\n- Once you pick a branch, treat all bullets under that branch as mandatory, and do not mix incompatible paths unless explicitly told to merge.\n- Language, tone, structural cues, and conditional behaviors are all inspected.\n",
