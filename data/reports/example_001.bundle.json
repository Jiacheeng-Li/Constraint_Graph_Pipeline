  "machine_prompt": "OVERALL TASK:\n- Write a short story showing cooperation among forest animals during a storm in a gentle, natural tone and ending with a reflective message.\n\nGLOBAL MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS:\nYou MUST satisfy ALL of the following properties throughout the entire answer:\n- The answer must be at least 184 words long (approximately comparable length to the provided reference).\n- The answer must be written primarily in English.\n- The answer must include an Opening/Intro section, a Main Analysis/Body section, and a Conclusion/Outlook section in logical progression.\n- The answer should maintain an objective, third-person analytic voice without using first-person pronouns.\n\nREQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE (STAGED PLAN):\nYour answer MUST be organized into the following stages / sections.\nYou do not need to literally copy these headings, but you MUST perform the listed duties.\n\nStage B1 — Opening:\n- This stage is 'Opening'. You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).\n  • Establish the setting as a forest morning with a coming storm\n  • Introduce at least four different animal characters\n  • Show animals performing cooperative storm preparation actions\n  • Maintain gentle natural tone throughout the opening\n  • Establish the storm as an immediate threat with urgent language\n  • Describe animals responding to the storm with emergency coordination rather than gentle cooperation\n  • Maintain a tone of urgency and imminent danger throughout the opening\n  • Include direct communication between animals showing emergency coordination\n\nStage B2 — Main Analysis:\n- This stage is 'Main Analysis'. You MUST: Follow these sub-steps IN ORDER.\n  • Describe the storm's arrival and immediate effects\n  • Show animals huddling together in shared shelter\n  • Include specific animal interactions during the storm\n  • Describe the storm's aftermath when animals emerge\n\nStage B3 — Context setup:\n- This stage is 'Context setup'. You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).\n  • Include at least three specific animal actions showing cooperation\n  • Reference the time period of 'through the following day'\n  • Show progression from individual actions to collective outcome\n  • Include the outcome of 'forest seemed alive with quiet gratitude'\n\nStage B4 — Conclusion:\n- This stage is 'Conclusion'. You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).\n  • Include a reflective message about cooperation and strength\n  • Maintain a gentle, natural tone throughout the conclusion\n\nCONDITIONAL BRANCH REQUIREMENTS:\nSome stages include branching logic. You MUST clearly choose ONE branch that applies, and then satisfy ONLY that branch's obligations.\n\nIn stage B1 Opening:\nIF If the story needs to emphasize immediate danger and urgent collective action rather than gentle cooperation THEN you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:\n    • Establish the storm as an immediate threat with urgent language\n    • Describe animals responding to the storm with emergency coordination rather than gentle cooperation\n    • Maintain a tone of urgency and imminent danger throughout the opening\n    • Include direct communication between animals showing emergency coordination\nELSE (if the condition does not apply), you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:\n    • Establish the setting as a forest morning with a coming storm\n    • Introduce at least four different animal characters\n    • Show animals performing cooperative storm preparation actions\n    • Maintain gentle natural tone throughout the opening\n\nEVALUATION NOTICE:\n- Your answer will be automatically checked against the global constraints, the stage duties, and (if applicable) the branch you chose.\n- You MUST clearly follow EXACTLY ONE branch for each conditional stage. Do NOT merge branches.\n- Automated verifiers will check things like required language, tone, length, inclusion of specific elements, actionable recommendations, numbered items, etc.\n",
