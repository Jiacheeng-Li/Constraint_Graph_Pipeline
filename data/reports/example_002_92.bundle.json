EVALUATION NOTICE\n- Automated checks will verify every global rule, each stage’s duties, and the branch-specific obligations you triggered.\n- Once you pick a branch, treat all bullets under that branch as mandatory, and do not mix incompatible paths unless explicitly told to merge.\n- Language, tone, structural cues, and conditional behaviors are all inspected.\n",
