**Title:** *The Storm and the Grove*  

One morning, the forest woke to a sky heavy with gray. The wind whispered through the leaves, warning of a coming storm. Squirrel dashed about, trying to gather the last acorns, while Rabbit helped pull branches to reinforce the hollow where they all sometimes rested. Above them, Finch called out, “Tie the leaves together! The rain will be fierce!” Even the slow Tortoise dragged fallen bark toward the roots of an old oak, making a sturdy shelter.

By afternoon, the storm came roaring. Rain thudded on the canopy, and lightning flashed beyond the hills. The animals huddled together inside their shared shelter—fur, feathers, and shells pressed close. Squirrel trembled, but Bear’s deep voice rumbled softly, calming them. Finch fluttered near the entrance, watching until the thunder passed. When the wind finally eased, they all stepped out to see broken branches and soaked nests scattered around.

They worked together through the following day. Beaver repaired the stream dam, Fox carried twigs for the smaller nests, and the deer cleared the paths again. Soon, the forest seemed alive with quiet gratitude.

When the sun returned, its light shone on every creature, large and small, each one helping another in some gentle way. From that day on, they remembered: a forest stands strong not because its trees are tall, but because its hearts grow together.
