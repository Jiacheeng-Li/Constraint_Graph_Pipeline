  "machine_prompt": "SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. MISSION BRIEF & DELIVERABLE\n   - Primary directive: Write a detailed Markdown-formatted cooking guide for homemade pasta with tomato basil sauce in an instructive yet friendly tone.\n\n2. NON-NEGOTIABLE GLOBAL RULES\n   Respect every rule simultaneously across the full response:\n   1. Limit the response to a maximum of 235 words.\n   2. The answer must be written primarily in English.\n   3. Write a minimum of 13 paragraphs.\n   4. Ensure lists consistently use the '-' marker.\n   5. Keep the register impersonal; avoid first-person references.\n   6. Include clear dietary or suitability notices where relevant\n   7. Use numbered steps and bullet points for structured instructions\n   8. Provide optional or substitution suggestions for flexibility\n   9. Use bold text to highlight key ingredients or steps\n   10. Maintain a neutral, instructional tone throughout\n\n3. STRUCTURED RESPONSE BLUEPRINT\n   Work chronologically through each stage. Tasks must already be described with the condition that governs when they apply.\n\n   Stage 1 – Title\n      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.\n      Timeline duties:\n        • Include a title with the text 'Homemade Pasta with Tomato Basil Sauce'\n        • Format the title as a level 1 heading using Markdown\n        • Include a pasta emoji (🍝) in the title\n\n   Stage 2 – Notice\n      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.\n      Timeline duties:\n        • State that the recipe is not suitable for vegetarians\n        • Include a notice section with a warning header\n\n   Stage 3 – Step Instruction\n      Logic cue: Sequential micro-steps: address bullets in a flowing order.\n      Timeline duties:\n        • Knead for about 10 minutes until smooth\n        • Make a well in the center of the flour\n        • Mix until the dough comes together\n        • Add eggs, salt, and olive oil\n        • Wrap and rest for 30 minutes\n\n   Stage 4 – Step Instruction\n      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.\n      LOCAL branch – when The cooking guide is aimed at beginners who need more detailed troubleshooting guidance:\n        - Step 1: Step Instruction\n            • Include specific thickness measurements for rolling the dough\n            • Provide troubleshooting advice for common pasta rolling problems\n            • Explain how to test if the pasta is rolled correctly before cutting\n      Otherwise at this same decision point:\n        - Step 1: Step Instruction\n            • Use a pasta roller or rolling pin to flatten the dough\n            • Cut the flattened dough into thin fettuccine strips\n            • Sprinkle flour to prevent sticking\n\n   Stage 5 – Step Instruction\n      Logic cue: Sequential micro-steps: address bullets in a flowing order.\n      GLOBAL branch – when The cooking guide is for a quick 15-minute meal version:\n        - Step 1: Step Instruction\n            • Use canned crushed tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes to save preparation time\n            • Specify a shorter simmer time of 5-7 minutes for the sauce\n            • Include instruction to use dried basil as an alternative to fresh basil\n            • Mention that this quick version maintains good flavor despite shorter cooking time\n        - Step 2: Step Instruction\n            • Diagnose at least two critical failures driving the alternate scenario.\n            • Maintain an openly critical tone that assigns accountability for those failures.\n        - Step 3: Tips\n            • Lay out an urgent recovery plan using numbered steps.\n            • Highlight the need for rapid collaborative action to stabilize the situation.\n      Otherwise at this same decision point:\n        - Step 1: Step Instruction\n            • List tomatoes as an ingredient with quantity 3 ripe chopped\n            • List garlic as an ingredient with quantity 2 cloves minced\n            • List olive oil as an ingredient with quantity 2 tbsp\n            • Instruct to sauté garlic in olive oil until fragrant\n            • Instruct to add tomatoes and simmer for 15 minutes\n              - Step 1: Step Instruction\n                  • Include instructions to reserve pasta water before draining\n                  • Specify using reserved pasta water to adjust sauce consistency\n                  • Mention finishing with fresh basil leaves instead of just parmesan\n                  • Recommend letting pasta rest in sauce for 1-2 minutes before serving\n              - Step 1: Step Instruction\n                  • Boil pasta for 3–4 minutes until al dente\n                  • Mention parmesan cheese as optional\n                  • Drain the pasta after boiling\n                  • Toss pasta with the sauce\n              - Step 1: Tips\n                  • Suggest sun-dried tomatoes as a flavor-enhancing alternative to fresh tomatoes\n                  • Provide instructions for making the sauce ahead of time and proper storage methods\n                  • Include at least two creative variations for the sauce beyond the basic recipe\n              - Step 1: Tips\n                  • Suggest canned crushed tomatoes as an alternative if fresh tomatoes are unavailable\n                  • Recommend serving the pasta immediately for optimal texture\n        Continue executing the timeline under this branch:\n        - Step 2: Step Instruction\n            Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.\n            LOCAL branch – when The cooking guide is for advanced cooks who want to enhance flavor complexity:\n            Otherwise at this same decision point:\n        - Step 3: Tips\n            Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.\n            LOCAL branch – when The cooking guide is targeted at advanced home cooks who want to experiment with variations and storage options:\n            Otherwise at this same decision point:\n      Global path note: Once you enter this alternate storyline, remain on it until it naturally merges back into the main sequence.\n\n4. CURRENT CONDITION ASSUMPTION\n   Unless the evaluator states otherwise, assume each trigger below is currently FALSE.\n   - Step Instruction: The cooking guide is not aimed at beginners who need more detailed troubleshooting guidance.\n   - Step Instruction: The cooking guide is not for a quick 15-minute meal version.\n   - Step Instruction: The cooking guide is not for advanced cooks who want to enhance flavor complexity.\n   - Tips: The cooking guide is not targeted at advanced home cooks who want to experiment with variations and storage options.\n\n5. EVALUATION NOTICE\n- Automated checks will verify every global rule, each stage’s duties, and the branch-specific obligations you triggered.\n- Once you pick a branch, treat all bullets under that branch as mandatory, and do not mix incompatible paths unless explicitly told to merge.\n- Language, tone, structural cues, and conditional behaviors are all inspected.\n",
