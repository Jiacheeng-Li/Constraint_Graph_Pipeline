You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).\n  • Maintain a neutral, analytical tone without emotional or inflammatory language.\n  • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the topic with at least 50 words.\n\nStage B2 — TBD:\n- This stage is 'TBD'. You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).\n  • Maintain a neutral, analytical tone without emotional or inflammatory language.\n  • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the topic with at least 50 words.\n  • Adopt an explicitly critical tone highlighting concrete problems or failures.\n  • Propose at least one concrete next-step action to address the identified problems.\n\nStage B3 — TBD:\n- This stage is 'TBD'. You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).\n  • Maintain a neutral, analytical tone without emotional or inflammatory language.\n  • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the topic with at least 50 words.\n  • Adopt an explicitly critical tone highlighting concrete problems or failures.\n  • Propose at least one concrete next-step action to address the identified problems.\n\nStage B4 — TBD:\n- This stage is 'TBD'.

You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).\n  • Maintain a neutral, analytical tone without emotional or inflammatory language.\n  • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the topic with at least 50 words.\n\nCONDITIONAL BRANCH REQUIREMENTS:\nSome stages include branching logic. You MUST clearly choose ONE branch that applies, and then satisfy ONLY that branch's obligations.\n\nIn stage B2 TBD:\nIF If the stance is critical/negative THEN you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:\n    • Adopt an explicitly critical tone highlighting concrete problems or failures.\n    • Propose at least one concrete next-step action to address the identified problems.\nELSE (if the condition does not apply), you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:\n    • Maintain a neutral, analytical tone without emotional or inflammatory language.\n    • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the topic with at least 50 words.\n\nIn stage B3 TBD:\nIF If the stance is critical/negative THEN you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:\n    • Adopt an explicitly critical tone highlighting concrete problems or failures.\n    • Propose at least one concrete next-step action to address the identified problems.\nELSE (if the condition does not apply), you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:\n    • Maintain a neutral, analytical tone without emotional or inflammatory language.\n    • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the topic with at least 50 words.\n\nIn stage B4 TBD:\nIF If the stance is critical/negative THEN you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:\n    • Adopt an explicitly critical tone highlighting concrete problems or failures.\n    • Propose at least one concrete next-step action to address the identified problems.\nELSE (if the condition does not apply), you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:\n    • Maintain a neutral, analytical tone without emotional or inflammatory language.\n    • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the topic with at least 50 words.\n\nEVALUATION NOTICE:\n- Your answer will be automatically checked against the global constraints, the stage duties, and (if applicable) the branch you chose.\n- You MUST clearly follow EXACTLY ONE branch for each conditional stage. Do NOT merge branches.\n- Automated verifiers will check things like required language, tone, length, inclusion of specific elements, actionable recommendations, numbered items, etc.\n",
