3. STRUCTURED RESPONSE BLUEPRINT
   Work chronologically through each stage. Tasks must already be described with the condition that governs when they apply.

   Stage 1 – Title
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      Timeline duties:
        • Include a descriptive title that identifies the dish
        • Use an emoji relevant to the topic in the title
        • Format the title as a top-level heading

   Stage 2 – Notice
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      Timeline duties:
        • Use an attention-grabbing visual marker in the notice heading
        • State a clear dietary limitation for the recipe
        • Include a prominent dietary restriction notice

   Stage 3 – Step Instruction
      Logic cue: Sequential micro-steps: address bullets in a flowing order.
      Timeline duties:
        • List required ingredients with quantities before providing preparation steps
        • Include specific time durations for time-sensitive steps
        • Present preparation steps in numbered sequence
        • Provide clear action verbs for each step

   Stage 4 – Step Instruction
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      LOCAL branch – when The cooking guide is targeted at beginners with limited kitchen equipment:
        • Provide detailed visual cues for determining proper dough thickness without specialized tools
        • Offer alternative methods using common household items when specialized equipment is unavailable
        • Include specific troubleshooting advice for common beginner mistakes in pasta rolling
        • Use encouraging, reassuring language to build confidence for first-time pasta makers
      Otherwise at this same decision point:
        • List at least three distinct preparation actions for the current step
        • Include at least one preventative measure or troubleshooting tip
        • Present numbered step instructions with clear action verbs
        • Specify tools or equipment needed for the step

   Stage 5 – Step Instruction
      Logic cue: Sequential micro-steps: address bullets in a flowing order.
      GLOBAL branch – when The cooking guide is targeted at advanced chefs who prefer improvisational cooking with flexible measurements:
        - Step 1: Step Instruction
            • Use descriptive measurements instead of precise quantities (e.g., 'a generous drizzle', 'a handful')
            • Include sensory cues and visual indicators for doneness instead of exact timing
            • Provide technique variations and optional ingredient substitutions
            • Frame instructions as suggestions rather than rigid numbered steps
        - Step 2: Step Instruction
            • Explain how to develop deeper flavor complexity through extended simmering or ingredient layering
        - Step 3: Step Instruction
            • Diagnose at least two critical failures driving the alternate scenario.
            • Maintain an openly critical tone that assigns accountability for those failures.
        - Step 4: Tips
            • Lay out an urgent recovery plan using numbered steps.
            • Highlight the need for rapid collaborative action to stabilize the situation.
      Otherwise at this same decision point:
        - Step 1: Step Instruction
            • List required ingredients with quantities and preparation notes
            • Include cooking times or duration indicators where relevant
            • Present numbered steps in chronological cooking order
        - Step 2: Step Instruction
            Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
            LOCAL branch – when The cooking guide is targeted at advanced cooks who prefer detailed technique explanations over basic instructions:
              • Explain the scientific reason behind the cooking time and technique
              • Provide alternative cooking methods beyond basic boiling
              • Include advanced serving and plating techniques
              • Specify temperature control and water salinity requirements
            Otherwise at this same decision point:
              • Offer at least one optional ingredient or variation
              • Include a visual or textural cue for doneness
              • Provide a specific cooking time instruction
              • List sequential preparation steps
        - Step 3: Tips
            Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
            LOCAL branch – when The cooking guide is aimed at advanced home cooks who want to optimize flavor complexity:
              • Provide at least two flavor-enhancing techniques beyond basic substitutions
              • Include specific ingredient quality recommendations for superior results
              • Recommend advanced preparation methods that enhance flavor development
            Otherwise at this same decision point:
              • Provide at least one substitution option for a core ingredient
              • Include timing or serving recommendation for optimal results
      Global path note: Once you enter this alternate storyline, remain on it until it naturally merges back into the main sequence.

4. CURRENT CONDITION ASSUMPTION
   Unless the evaluator states otherwise, assume each trigger below is currently FALSE.
   - Step Instruction: The cooking guide is not targeted at beginners with limited kitchen equipment.
   - Step Instruction: The cooking guide is not targeted at advanced chefs who prefer improvisational cooking with flexible measurements.
   - Step Instruction: The cooking guide is not targeted at advanced cooks who prefer detailed technique explanations over basic instructions.
   - Tips: The cooking guide is not aimed at advanced home cooks who want to optimize flavor complexity.

5. EVALUATION NOTICE
- Automated checks will verify every global rule, each stage’s duties, and the branch-specific obligations you triggered.
- Once you pick a branch, treat all bullets under that branch as mandatory, and do not mix incompatible paths unless explicitly told to merge.
- Language, tone, structural cues, and conditional behaviors are all inspected.
