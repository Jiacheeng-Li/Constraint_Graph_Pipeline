REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE (STAGED PLAN):
Your answer MUST be organized into the following stages / sections.
You do not need to literally copy these headings, but you MUST perform the listed duties.

Stage B1 — TBD:
- This stage is 'TBD'. You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).
  • Maintain a neutral, analytical tone without emotional or inflammatory language.
  • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the topic with at least 50 words.
  • Adopt an explicitly critical tone highlighting concrete problems or failures.
  • Propose at least one concrete next-step action to address the identified problems.

Stage B2 — TBD:
- This stage is 'TBD'. You MUST: Cover ALL of the following points (logical AND).
  • Maintain a neutral, analytical tone without emotional or inflammatory language.
  • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the topic with at least 50 words.

Stage B3 — TBD:

  • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the topic with at least 50 words.
  • Adopt an explicitly critical tone highlighting concrete problems or failures.
  • Propose at least one concrete next-step action to address the identified problems.

CONDITIONAL BRANCH REQUIREMENTS:
Some stages include branching logic. You MUST clearly choose ONE branch that applies, and then satisfy ONLY that branch's obligations.

In stage B1 TBD:
IF If the stance is critical/negative THEN you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:
    • Adopt an explicitly critical tone highlighting concrete problems or failures.
    • Propose at least one concrete next-step action to address the identified problems.

    • Maintain a neutral, analytical tone without emotional or inflammatory language.
    • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the topic with at least 50 words.

In stage B3 TBD:
IF If the stance is critical/negative THEN you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:
    • Adopt an explicitly critical tone highlighting concrete problems or failures.

ELSE (if the condition does not apply), you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:
    • Maintain a neutral, analytical tone without emotional or inflammatory language.
    • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the topic with at least 50 words.

EVALUATION NOTICE:
- Your answer will be automatically checked against the global constraints, the stage duties, and (if applicable) the branch you chose.
- You MUST clearly follow EXACTLY ONE branch for each conditional stage. Do NOT merge branches.
- Automated verifiers will check things like required language, tone, length, inclusion of specific elements, actionable recommendations, numbered items, etc.
