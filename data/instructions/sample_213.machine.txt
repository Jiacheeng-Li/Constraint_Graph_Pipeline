SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS:

1. MISSION BRIEF & DELIVERABLE
   - Primary directive: Compare and contrast the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War.

2. NON-NEGOTIABLE GLOBAL RULES
   Respect every rule simultaneously across the full response:
   1. Include an Opening/Intro, a Body/Main Analysis, and a Conclusion/Outlook in logical progression.
   2. Do not use the symbol ':'.
   3. Use these keywords verbatim somewhere in the text: "vietnam", "cuban", "missile".
   4. Write the response mostly in English.
   5. Provide at least 320 words in total.
   6. Highlight key differences between subjects to aid understanding.
   7. Conclude with a summary that reinforces the main points.
   8. Provide background context to help frame the discussion.
   9. Use a neutral and informative tone suitable for historical analysis.
   10. Prefer clear and logical reasoning when comparing and contrasting topics.

3. STRUCTURED RESPONSE BLUEPRINT
   Work chronologically through each stage. Tasks must already be described with the condition that governs when they apply.

   Stage 1 - Opening
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      Timeline duties:
        • Acknowledge both similarities and differences between the subjects

   Stage 2 - Background
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      Timeline duties:
        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 50 words.

   Stage 3 - Main Analysis
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      Timeline duties:
        • Present at least one key characteristic of the second case being contrasted

   Stage 4 - Main Analysis
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      LOCAL branch - when The analysis requires a more analytical and data-driven approach rather than narrative historical comparison:
        • Include specific polling data or statistics to quantify public opinion levels
        • Analyze at least three distinct demographic factors that influenced public opinion differently in each conflict
        • Compare the media coverage patterns and their impact on public perception between the two events
        • Maintain an objective, data-focused tone throughout the analysis
      Otherwise at this same decision point:
        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 60 words.
        • Provide concrete evidence of public sentiment for each case
        • Contrast the outcomes or consequences of public opinion between cases
        • Compare at least two cases on a specific dimension of public opinion

   Stage 5 - Conclusion
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      LOCAL branch - when The conclusion needs to emphasize policy implications and lessons learned rather than just summarizing differences:
        • Explicitly state at least two policy lessons or strategic implications drawn from comparing these events
        • Use language that emphasizes strategic importance and contemporary relevance
        • Maintain a forward-looking perspective that connects historical analysis to modern contexts
        • Explicitly mark the block as a conclusion with implications
      Otherwise at this same decision point:
        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 40 words.
        • Restate the main comparative framework established earlier in the response
        • Summarize key contrasting attributes for each case
        • Explicitly mark the block as a conclusion

4. CURRENT CONDITION ASSUMPTION
   Unless the evaluator states otherwise, assume each trigger below is currently FALSE.
   - Main Analysis: It is not the case that the analysis requires a more analytical and data-driven approach rather than narrative historical comparison.
   - Conclusion: It is not the case that the conclusion needs to emphasize policy implications and lessons learned rather than just summarizing differences.
