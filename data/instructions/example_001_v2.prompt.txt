EVALUATION NOTICE:
- Your answer will be automatically checked against the global constraints, the stage duties, and (if applicable) the branch you chose.
- You MUST clearly follow EXACTLY ONE branch for each conditional stage. Do NOT merge branches.
- Automated verifiers will check things like required language, tone, length, inclusion of specific elements, actionable recommendations, numbered items, etc.
