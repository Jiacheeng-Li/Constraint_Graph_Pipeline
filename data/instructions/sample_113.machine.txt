SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS:

1. MISSION BRIEF & DELIVERABLE
   - Primary directive: Compare and contrast the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War.

2. NON-NEGOTIABLE GLOBAL RULES
   Respect every rule simultaneously across the full response:
   1. Limit the response to a maximum of 450 words.
   2. Write without contractions (e.g., 'cannot' instead of 'can't').
   3. Structure the answer with an Introduction, a Main Body, and a Conclusion.
   4. The answer must mention the following keywords: "vietnam", "cuban", "missile".
   5. Prefer clear and logical reasoning when comparing concepts.
   6. Provide explanations of reasons and background for each point.
   7. Maintain a formal and academic tone throughout the response.
   8. Use concrete historical examples to support comparisons.
   9. Avoid vague or ambiguous phrasing to improve comprehensibility.

3. STRUCTURED RESPONSE BLUEPRINT
   Work chronologically through each stage. Tasks must already be described with the condition that governs when they apply.

   Stage 1 - Opening
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      Timeline duties:
        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 30 words.
        • Introduce both subjects by name and timeframe
        • Place both events in a shared historical context
        • State that the subjects share common characteristics

   Stage 2 - Context setup
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      Timeline duties:
        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 50 words.
        • Explicitly signal the comparison using contrastive language
        • Define the second subject with its key characteristics and duration
        • Identify the main participants or stakeholders for each subject

   Stage 3 - Main Analysis
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      Timeline duties:
        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 60 words.
        • Present at least one key characteristic of the first case being compared
        • Describe the outcome or resolution of the first case
        • Present at least one key characteristic of the second case being contrasted

   Stage 4 - Main Analysis
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      LOCAL branch - when The analysis requires a more critical examination of government communication and media influence on public perception:
        • Analyze how government messaging and media coverage shaped public opinion differently in each conflict
        • Critically assess the role of propaganda or information control in maintaining or undermining public support
        • Provide specific examples of media narratives or government communications that influenced domestic attitudes
        • Maintain a critical analytical tone questioning official narratives
      Otherwise at this same decision point:
        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 60 words.
        • Compare at least two cases on a specific dimension of difference
        • Highlight the contrasting outcomes or consequences for each case
        • Provide concrete evidence for each case being compared

   Stage 5 - Conclusion
      Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
      LOCAL branch - when The conclusion needs to emphasize the broader strategic implications and lessons learned from these Cold War events:
        • Explicitly state at least three strategic lessons or implications for Cold War policy
        • Use a forward-looking perspective that discusses how these events shaped subsequent foreign policy
        • Maintain an analytical tone focused on strategic assessment rather than simple factual summary
        • Connect the specific case differences to broader Cold War dynamics and superpower relations
      Otherwise at this same decision point:
        • Provide a sufficiently detailed explanation in this block with at least 40 words.
        • Restate the main comparative categories used in the analysis
        • Use parallel structure when contrasting the two cases
        • Summarize the key differences between the two cases

4. CURRENT CONDITION ASSUMPTION
   Unless the evaluator states otherwise, assume each trigger below is currently FALSE.
   - Main Analysis: It is not the case that the analysis requires a more critical examination of government communication and media influence on public perception.
   - Conclusion: It is not the case that the conclusion needs to emphasize the broader strategic implications and lessons learned from these cold war events.
