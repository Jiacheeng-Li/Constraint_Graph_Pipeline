- The answer should maintain an objective, third-person analytic voice without using first-person pronouns.

REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE (STAGED PLAN):
Your answer MUST be organized into the following stages / sections.
You do not need to literally copy these headings, but you MUST perform the listed duties.

  • Introduce at least four different animal characters
  • Show animals performing cooperative storm preparation actions
  • Maintain gentle natural tone throughout the opening

  • Describe animals responding to the storm with emergency coordination rather than gentle cooperation
  • Maintain a tone of urgency and imminent danger throughout the opening
  • Include direct communication between animals showing emergency coordination

Stage B2 — Main Analysis:

  • Describe the storm's arrival and immediate effects
  • Show animals huddling together in shared shelter
  • Include specific animal interactions during the storm

  • Include a reflective message about cooperation and strength
  • Maintain a gentle, natural tone throughout the conclusion

CONDITIONAL BRANCH REQUIREMENTS:
Some stages include branching logic. You MUST clearly choose ONE branch that applies, and then satisfy ONLY that branch's obligations.

In stage B1 Opening:
IF If the story needs to emphasize immediate danger and urgent collective action rather than gentle cooperation THEN you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:
    • Establish the storm as an immediate threat with urgent language
    • Describe animals responding to the storm with emergency coordination rather than gentle cooperation
    • Maintain a tone of urgency and imminent danger throughout the opening
    • Include direct communication between animals showing emergency coordination
ELSE (if the condition does not apply), you MUST satisfy ALL of these requirements:
    • Establish the setting as a forest morning with a coming storm
    • Introduce at least four different animal characters
    • Show animals performing cooperative storm preparation actions
    • Maintain gentle natural tone throughout the opening

EVALUATION NOTICE:
- Your answer will be automatically checked against the global constraints, the stage duties, and (if applicable) the branch you chose.
- You MUST clearly follow EXACTLY ONE branch for each conditional stage. Do NOT merge branches.
- Automated verifiers will check things like required language, tone, length, inclusion of specific elements, actionable recommendations, numbered items, etc.
