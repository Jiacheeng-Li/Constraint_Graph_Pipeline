            Logic cue: Parallel coverage: hit every bullet for this stage.
            LOCAL branch – when The cooking guide is for advanced cooks who want to enhance flavor complexity:
              • Reserve 1/4 cup of pasta water before draining to use in sauce
              • Specify that pasta should be tossed with sauce over low heat for 30 seconds to meld flavors
