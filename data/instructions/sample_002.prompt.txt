Begin by writing a detailed Markdown-formatted cooking guide for homemade pasta with tomato basil sauce, adopting an instructive yet friendly tone. The guide must be approximately 200 words, with a deviation allowance of plus or minus 15 percent. Do not use contractions, and ensure the response contains at least 13 paragraphs. Maintain heading-level consistency using only levels one and two, and write in an objective, third-person tone. Provide clear, sequential step-by-step instructions, highlight important notices or warnings prominently, and include practical tips and substitutions for accessibility. Integrate concise ingredient lists into each relevant step, and sustain a friendly, encouraging tone with optional suggestions throughout.

Start with the opening stage, which requires a sufficiently detailed explanation of at least 30 words. Include an emoji in the title to create a friendly, inviting tone, and begin with a clear, descriptive title for the guide.

Next, in the notice stage, provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of at least 30 words. Include a prominent dietary restriction notice using visual emphasis, and state a specific dietary incompatibility clearly.

Proceed to the step instructions stage, where you must give a sufficiently detailed explanation of at least 40 words. Include specific time durations for steps where applicable, list required ingredients with quantities and units, and present numbered steps in sequential order.

Continue with another step instructions stage. If the cooking guide targets complete beginners who need more detailed visual guidance, then include specific thickness measurements for rolling the dough, provide alternative cutting methods for those without pasta machines, include a troubleshooting tip for common pasta-making problems, and use numbered steps instead of bullet points for sequential actions. Otherwise, at this same decision point, use a consistent bullet style with a hyphen for list items in this block, present a numbered step with a clear title, include a precaution or tip within the step, and list at least three distinct actions in bullet points.

Move on to the final step instructions stage. If the cooking guide is intended for experienced cooks who prefer improvisational cooking with flexible measurements and techniques, then for step one, use descriptive measurements instead of precise quantities, include at least two alternative preparation methods or ingredient substitutions, provide sensory cues and visual indicators instead of strict timing, and maintain an encouraging, flexible tone that emphasizes personal preference and experimentation. For step two, diagnose at least two critical failures driving the alternate scenario and maintain an openly critical tone that assigns accountability for those failures. For step three, lay out an urgent recovery plan using numbered steps and highlight the need for rapid collaborative action to stabilize the situation. Otherwise, at this same decision point, for step one, provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of at least 30 words, list required ingredients with quantities and preparation notes, include cooking times or duration indicators where relevant, and present numbered steps in chronological order. For step two, if the cooking guide is targeted at complete beginners who need extra reassurance and troubleshooting help, then include at least two specific troubleshooting tips for common pasta cooking mistakes, provide reassurance about timing flexibility with a friendly, encouraging tone, include a visual test method for checking pasta doneness beyond just time, and use first-person plural pronouns to create a collaborative cooking experience. Otherwise, at this same decision point, provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of at least 30 words, provide a draining instruction after cooking, specify a cooking time range for boiling pasta, and include a visual or textural cue for doneness. For step three, if the cooking guide is targeted at advanced home cooks who want to elevate their pasta dish beyond basic recipes, then provide at least three advanced technique tips that go beyond basic substitutions, include at least one wine pairing recommendation for the finished dish, suggest at least two gourmet ingredient additions for elevating the sauce, and provide plating and presentation advice for restaurant-quality appearance. Otherwise, at this same decision point, provide a bulleted list in this block with at least two items, provide at least one substitution option for a key ingredient, and include timing or serving advice for optimal results. Once you enter this alternate storyline for experienced cooks, remain on it until it naturally merges back into the main sequence.

Unless stated otherwise, assume the cooking guide does not target complete beginners needing more detailed visual guidance, is not intended for experienced cooks preferring improvisational cooking, is not targeted at complete beginners needing extra reassurance and troubleshooting help, and is not targeted at advanced home cooks wanting to elevate their pasta dish beyond basic recipes.
